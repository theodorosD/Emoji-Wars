**What‚Äôs this?**  
An AI-powered, real-time emoji battle game‚Äîstarring **Qwen-3**, the fresh new LLM on the block, running ultra-fast on **Cerebras**‚Äô hardware.  
You and Qwen each get a hand of wild emojis (from lions to laptops to pizza). Play your emoji, Qwen plays one too, and our favorite LLM decides who wins (with explanations that are sometimes brilliant and sometimes, well, creative).

**What‚Äôs actually fun?**
- Sometimes Qwen thinks a giraffe is a hyena. We call it a feature, not a bug.
- Zero setup‚Äîjust bring your own API key and play instantly.
- The game is all in your browser. Code is honest, fast, and full of hackathon spirit.

**Tech**
- HTML + JS (no frameworks)
- **Cerebras Qwen-3** 
- Judges keep their API keys safe

**With more time we‚Äôd add‚Ä¶**
- Power-ups (spells! wildcards! shields!)
- Themed emoji pools (food, fantasy, sports‚Ä¶)
- Multiplayer, sounds, and maybe a ‚Äúpizza always wins‚Äù button

Give it a spin and enjoy the chaos!
